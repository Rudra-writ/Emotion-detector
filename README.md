# Real time Emotion detector
A software to detect emotions based on facial expression using CNN and OpenCV

The python files to be executed in the following sequences --> Preprocessing_data.py ---> Convolutional neural Network.py ----> Execution.py

The train dataset used, "Face expression recognition dataset" is a contribution from Mr. Jonathan Oheix and is downloadble from Kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

Early stopping has been used to reduce over fitting by limiting the epochs to 12. However the results achieved, is still satisfying. Accuracy for some expressions like "fear" and "happy" being over 90%
